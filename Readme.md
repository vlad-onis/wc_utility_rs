# Word count utility

This utility is inspired from the linux wc utility that provides a robust set of useful tools to quickly analyze files.

My tool was born because of the challange here: https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc/

It is in no way battle ready and it's not meant to be as robust as the linux one. A good example here would be testing it on an arabic language or with emojis and graphemes clusters.

This tool is meant to pass the tests from the challenge while being a good display of power and performing better then the linux one when measured with the **time** utility.
